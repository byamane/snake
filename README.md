# Snake!

 🐍 Enter the world of Snake! 🐍 
 
 The snake will move either by the arrow keys or the virtual arrow keypad. The goal of the game is to eat as many grapes as you can, and ultimately prove your skill by achieving a new high score! But beware! Only those with the utmost precision and control will be victorious! Crashing into any of the walls or your own body will cause the game to end. Good luck gamer! 😄
